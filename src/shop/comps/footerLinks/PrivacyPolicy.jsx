          Please bare in mind that this is a very, very small operation -
          myself, E. J. Mainwaring, taking orders online, processing, and then
          posting them. Any data I collect through here will be used to post
          your items to you, and that is all. This website is essentially a
          digital merch table, but the below information is now a requirement, I
          think - I don't really know what it all means, to be honest. I can
          barely sell a CD of my own music, never mind somebody's data.
